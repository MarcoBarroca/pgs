# Summary of results:

As per our theoretical work, if we can represent a spatial symmetry using a permutation operator, R, that commutes with the Hamiltonian then we can use the formalism developed in the 'Tapering off qubits' paper to reduce the number of qubits required for the fermionic simulation. So, the code in this repository contains the R matrices for different molecules. 

Corresponding to the point group symmetries in different molecules we were able to construct the R matrices

Plane of symmetry:
Center of symmetry or inversion center:
