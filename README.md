# Tapering off qubits using the point group symmetries.

This repository contains the code based on qiskit for tapering off qubits using point group symmetries.

It uses qiskit-0.11.0 which can be installed by:

```pip3 install qiskit==0.11.0```

There is a demo jupyter notebook `tapering_using_point_group_symmetries.ipynb` that may be helpful in understanding the procedure.
